            <h1>The Beginning</h1>
            <p>

			<br>
			Until the summer of 2023 I - like most people - was barely aware of the existence of holography as a field.
			To the extent that I thought of it at all, I thought of the low quality holograms from the 80's and 90's I'd seen as a kid (perhaps they weren't even 
			holograms, they could have been low quality lenticular sheets). <br>
			<br>
			This all changed in the spring of 2023, when my friend <a href="https://www.sydneykoke.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney Koke</a> contacted me about meeting up in Taiwan, where I live.  Due to COVID, we hadn't seen each other in several 
			years, and as she happened to be going to Korea that July for a conference and so would be in the area, it seemed like a low cost way of getting a visit in (normally we live on different continents).
			However, with Sydney arriving in late June and with Taiwan at that time of year being hot enough to kill, I struggled to think of what we could do.  Fortunately, Sydney had developed a new passion in the years since
			we had last seen each other - holography.  She decided that since it was too hot to go outside, we would simply spend the week making analog holograms in my apartment.
			<br>
			<br>
			Sydney gave me a shopping list of items to procure - a low cost green laser, photoemulsion film, black velvet, plenty of small picture frames, etc.  Since I don't have a darkroom in my apartment, we simply 
			worked at night - staying up until 4AM every day that she was here, making very basic analog holograms.  Our most successful one, made using one of my 3D prints, is shown here:

			<br>
			Sydney's enthuasism was infectious, and so I ended up deciding to go to Korea with her and attend the conference (ISDH 2023) as well.  The quality of the holograms I saw there astonished me, and when I learnt 
			that one could use <em>digital holography</em> to make holograms of objects that exist only within the confines of your computer, I quickly realized
			that this could be the ideal artistic medium for mathematical objects not conducive to 3D printing.  I was hooked.
