      <h1>The Beginning</h1>
      <p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Until the summer of 2023 like most people I was barely aware of the existence of holography as a field.
        To the extent that I thought of it at all, I thought of the low quality holograms from the 80's and 90's I'd
        seen as a kid (perhaps they weren't even
        holograms, they could have been low quality lenticular sheets). <br>
        <br>
        This all changed in June 2023, when my friend <a href="https://www.sydneykoke.com/" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney Koke</a> visited me in Taiwan on her way to a conference in Korea.
        Since Taiwan at that time of year is hot enough to kill, I struggled to think of how I could show her the
        island. Fortunately, Sydney had developed a new passion since
        we had last seen each other - holography (indeed, this is what the conference was about). It was decided that
        since it was too hot to go outside, we would simply make analog holograms in my apartment.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sydney gave me a shopping list of items to procure - a low cost green laser, photoemulsion film, black velvet,
        plenty of small picture frames, etc. Since I don't have a darkroom in my apartment, we simply
        worked at night. Our most successful one, made using one of my 3D prints, is shown here:

      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      Sydney's enthuasism was so infectious that I ended up going to the holography conference (ISDH 2023) as well. The
      quality of the holograms I saw there astonished me, and when I learnt
      that one could use <em>digital holography</em> to make holograms of objects that exist only within the confines of
      your computer, I quickly realized
      that this could be the ideal artistic medium for mathematical objects not conducive to 3D printing. I was hooked.
