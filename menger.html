            <h1>3D diagonal cross-sections of 4D Menger sponges</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			I've been aware of Menger sponges and their relatives since university.  However, I never gave them much thought until I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2012/12/10/mathematical-impressions-the-surprising-menger-sponge-slice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the following video</a> by George Hart and the Simon's foundation about their diagonal cross-sections:
				
			This was in the spring of 2022.  The first thought was to 3D print the sponge in two halves in such such a way that there was a mechanism for locking the halves together and then pulling them apart.  I iterated
			on a few designs before eventually settling on this one - a steel 3D print with inlaid rare earth magnets.

			</figure>
			<br>
			<br>
			At the same time as I was iterating on this, a more interesting thought occurred to me - if the 3D Menger sponge has surprising and interesting 2D diagonal cross sections, then might same be true of the 3D diagonal cross-sections of a 4D Menger sponge?
			<br>
			Intuitively, it seemed that since the 3D Menger slice was a six-sided regular polygon with six-sided star holes, then a 4D Menger slice should be an eight-sided platonic solid with eight-sided star interior cavities.  The only eight-sided
			Platonic solid is the octagon, and it's stellation (the stellated octahedron) is an eight-pointed 3D star, so I conjectured that the 3D diagonal cross-section of a 4D Menger sponge would be an 
			octagon with a fractal pattern of stellated octahedrons as interior cavities - something like this:

			<p>I didn't yet know what I 4D Menger sponge was, but I had code for the 3D case and I guessed at how to generalize it to 4D.  The following shape popped out.</p>

			The video below makes it easier to make sense of the 3D structure of this object.  It is a truncated tetrahedron, each hexagonal face of which is the central diagonal cross-section of the 3D Menger sponge.

			<p>This was unexpected, but very interesting, and I got work figuring out what was going on.  The first thing to do is was to clarify what a 4D Menger sponge really is.  I won't go into the details here, but it turns out that
			there are n possible Menger sponges in n-dimensional space.  Karl Menger himself had pointed this out in his original work <sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>, but this fact seems to have been largely lost to time.  After I clarified this, I discoverd that a 4D Menger sponge with 3D cross-sections conforming
			to my intuition does exist, it is just different from the one I had coded up (also a valid 4D sponge, just a different type).  After I modified my code to produce any of the four possible 4D Menger sponges, the result I had originally expected popped out.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I had more difficulty explaining the unexpected truncated tetrahedron fractal above, but I eventually made sense of it by deriving a relationship between the cross sections of n dimenional menger sponges and those of (n-1)-dimensional sponges.
