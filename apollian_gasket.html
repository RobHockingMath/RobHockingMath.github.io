            <h1>3D Apollonian gasket Digital Hologram</h1>
            <p>
			<br>
			<br>
			Prior to arriving at ISDH 2023, I had signed up for an introductory holography course at the <a href="https://www.internationalschoolofholography.com/International" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International School of Holography.</a>  The teacher, Mellisa Crewshaw,
			had given me a list of names of people to try and meet.  On the first day, I found myself at lunch time seated next to a man with long, dark brown hair streaked here and there with grey.  As we talked, I realized he fit the profile of one of the people on my list.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>"Are you Michael Page from Ontario College of Art and Design?" I asked.</p>
			<p>"I am." the man replied.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Unlike Sydney and Mellisa, who focus on analog holography, Michael Page is a <em> Digital Holographer</em>.  As he explained the basics of the field to me that day over lunchtime, I came to realize just how much
			potential it has as an artistic medium.</p>
			<br>
			"So, from what you're saying, I don't even need to have a 3D mesh of an object to turn it into a digital hologram.  All I need is a way of producing images of it from different angles."
			<br>
			"Yes, in principle that's correct, but you'll be making life difficult for yourself.  You won't be able to able to use any of the 3D studio max scripts that make things easy." Michael replied.
			<br>
			"I could make a digital hologram of a black hole then."
			<br>
			"If you have a way of rendering one from any angle, then I suppose you could."
			<br>
			<p>Later in the day, I asked Michael how to get started.  "You want to talk to that guy over there."  Michael said, indicating a tall man with short dark hair, currently engaged in conversation.  I walked over and patiently waited for the conversation to end, before introducing myself.</p>
			<br>
			"People say you run a small business producing holograms."
			<br>
			"Yes."
			<br>
			"They say that all I have to do is email you a set of images of my object rendered from different angles, and you can turn it into a hologram."
			<br>
			"Yes."
			<br>
			"You have a 3D studio max script that will generate the images automatically."
			<br>
			"Yes."
			<br>
			"The 3D scene can change as you move the camera, so that the object in hologram will deform as you view it from different angles."
			<br>
			"Yes."
			<br>
			"How do I get in touch?"
			<br>
			"Here." the man said, handing me a business card.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>I had no way of knowing it at the time, but that brief conversation with Yves Gentet would mark a critical turning point in my life.</p>
			
			<p>After the conference, I didn't get started working on a hologram until February 2024.  I decided that rather than going straight for a black hole, I would first make life easy for myself and do something simple.
			At the time I had been experimented with different mediums for visualizing a 3D Apollonian gasket, first producing a 3D print that was an expensive failure, and then a glass etching that was better, but which I still
			somehow found unsatisfying.

			<p>These early experiments had generated 3D meshes of the Gasket with a relatively inefficient algorithm that required one to maintain an explicit list of all the spheres making up the Gasket.  My computer had difficulty 
			with more than about a million spheres, which limited the resolution of the Gasket.  However, I'd just coded up a more efficient version of the algorithm that maintained no such list and instead essentially provided a means
			of answering the question "does this point belong to the Gasket - yes or no?".  The result was a much higher resolution version of the gasket, and I decided that I would try it out as my first hologram.
