			I've been aware of Menger sponges and their relatives since university.  However, I never gave them much thought until I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2012/12/10/mathematical-impressions-the-surprising-menger-sponge-slice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the following video</a> by George Hart and the Simon's foundation about their diagonal cross-sections:
				
			This was in the spring of 2022.  The first thought was to 3D print the sponge in two halves in such such a way that there was a mechanism for locking the halves together and then pulling them apart.  I iterated
			on a few designs before eventually settling on this one - a steel 3D print with inlaid rare earth magnets.

			</figure>
			<br>
			<br>
			At the same time as I was iterating on this, a more interesting thought occurred to me - if the 3D Menger sponge has surprising and interesting 2D diagonal cross sections, then might same be true of the 3D diagonal cross-sections of a 4D Menger sponge?
			<br>
			Intuitively, it seemed that since the 3D Menger slice was a six-sided regular polygon with six-sided star holes, then a 4D Menger slice should be an eight-sided platonic solid with eight-sided star interior cavities.  The only eight-sided
			Platonic solid is the octagon, and it's stellation (the stellated octahedron) is an eight-pointed 3D star, so I conjectured that the 3D diagonal cross-section of a 4D Menger sponge would be an 
			octagon with a fractal pattern of stellated octahedrons as interior cavities - something like this:

			<br>
			<br>
			</p>
			I didn't yet know what I 4D Menger sponge was, but I had code for the 3D case and I guessed at how to generalize it to 4D.  The following shape popped out.

			<br>
			<br>
			It's a bit hard to tell from the photo, but this is a truncated tetrahedron, each hexagonal face of which is the central diagonal cross-section of the 3D Menger sponge.  This was unexpected, but very interesting.

			<br>
			Things started making more sense once I sat down and thought hard about what a 4D Menger sponge really is.  I found it helpful to define the sponge by labeling a rubik's cube with integer coordinates in {0,1,2} like this:
			<br>

			</figure>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			
			Preliminary reasoning 
			seemed to support this.  I knew from George Hart's video that the hexagon in the 3D Menger slice was the central intersection of a cube with a diagonal plane, while the hexagrams (six-pointed stars) came about because the Menger sponge is full of triplets
			of mutually orthogonal square based cylinders, and their central interesection with the same plane is a hexagram.  Although I didn't know at that point what a 4D Menger sponge was, I felt that it stood to reason that it should contain 
			quadruplets of mutually orthogonal cube-based hypercylinders.  I found that such quadruplets yielded stellated octahedrons (a type of eight-pointed 3D star) when intersected with the right hyperplane, while intersection with the hypercube 
			gave an octagon.  I therefore conjectured that the 3D diagonal cross-section of a 4D Menger sponge would be an octagon with a fractal pattern of stellated octahedrons as interior cavities - something like this:
