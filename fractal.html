			I've been aware of Menger sponges and their relatives since university.  However, I never gave them much thought until I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2012/12/10/mathematical-impressions-the-surprising-menger-sponge-slice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the following video</a> by George Hart and the Simon's foundation about their diagonal cross-sections:
				
			This was in the spring of 2022.  The first thought was to 3D print the sponge in two halves in such such a way that there was a mechanism for locking the halves together and then pulling them apart.  I iterated
			on a few designs before eventually settling on this one - a steel 3D print with inlaid rare earth magnets.

			</figure>
			<br>
			<br>
			At the same time as I was iterating on this, a more interesting thought occurred to me - if the 3D Menger sponge has surprising and interesting 2D diagonal cross sections, then might same be true of the 3D diagonal cross-sections of a 4D Menger sponge?
			<br>
			Intuitively, it seemed that since the 3D Menger slice was a six-sided regular polygon with six-sided star holes, then a 4D Menger slice should be an eight-sided platonic solid with eight-sided star interior cavities.  The only eight-sided
			Platonic solid is the octagon, and it's stellation (the stellated octahedron) is an eight-pointed 3D star, so I conjectured that the 3D diagonal cross-section of a 4D Menger sponge would be an 
			octagon with a fractal pattern of stellated octahedrons as interior cavities - something like this:

			I didn't yet know what I 4D Menger sponge was, but I had code for the 3D case and I guessed at how to generalize it to 4D.  The following shape popped out.

			The video below makes it easier to make sense of the 3D structure of this object.  It is a truncated tetrahedron, each hexagonal face of which is the central diagonal cross-section of the 3D Menger sponge.

			This was unexpected, but very interesting, and I got work figuring out what was going on.  The first thing to do is to figure out what a 4D Menger sponge really is.  I found it helpful to define the 3D sponge by labeling a rubik's cube with integer coordinates in {0,1,2} like this:
			<br>
			<div class="image-gallery">
			<figure>
				<img src="Rubic.png" alt="Description of Image 1" class="gallery-image">
				<figcaption>Together.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<br>
			<br>
			The Menger sponge could then be defined by the following rule: "Add up the coordinates of each subcube.  If that sum is at most one, the subcube is allowed to stay - otherwise it goes.  Likewise Partition all surviving subcubes and repeat".
			This formulation is useful because the upper bound on the sum is begging to be changed - let's call the bound "k".  If k is zero, and you end up with a 3D Cantor set.  Change it to two, and you get a kind of 3D Sierpiński carpet.  Change it to three, and you get the whole cube.
			
			You can play the same game in 2D.  If k is at most one, you get the 2D Cantor set.  If it's at most one, you get the Sierpiński carpet, if it's at most two you get the unit square.  In general, one can define in this way
			an n-dimensional Menger sponge of type k, where k is an integer between 0 and n.  This gives n+1 different Menger sponges in n-dimensional space.  I realized that the implementation of a 4D Menger sponge I had guessed was equivalent
			to a 4D Menger sponge of type one, but that I needed a 4D Menger sponge of type two to get the cross sections I had intuitively expected.  When I modified my code to generate a 4D sponge of type two, exactly the sections I had conjectured popped out.
			
			This was great, but it didn't explain why the cross-sections of 4D Menger sponge of type one all contained the central cross section of the 3D Menger sponge.  This puzzled me for several months, until one day it occured to me that every hyper-face of a 4D Menger sponge
			of type one would be an ordinary 3D Menger sponge.  It follows from that the faces of any cross-section of such a 4D menger sponge with a 3D hyperplane will all be intersections of the regular 3D Menger sponge with an associated 2D plane.
