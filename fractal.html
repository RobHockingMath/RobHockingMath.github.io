			I've been aware of Menger sponges and their relatives since university.  However, I never gave them much thought until I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2012/12/10/mathematical-impressions-the-surprising-menger-sponge-slice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the following video</a> by George Hart and the Simon's foundation about their diagonal cross-sections:
				
			This was in the spring of 2022.  The first thought was to 3D print the sponge in two halves in such such a way that there was a mechanism for locking the halves together and then pulling them apart.  I iterated
			on a few designs before eventually settling on this one - a steel 3D print with inlaid rare earth magnets. 
			<br>
			At the same time as I was iterating on this, a more interesting thought occurred to me - if the 3D Menger sponge has surprising and interesting 2D diagonal cross sections, then might same be true of the 3D diagonal cross-sections of a 4D Menger sponge?
