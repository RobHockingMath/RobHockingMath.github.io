            <h1>Fractal Geometry</h1>
            <p>
			My interest in fractals dates back to high school, when I was introduced by a friend to the Mandelbrot set.  Today, I am mainly interested in two broad types of fractals:
			<br>
				<p>1.  Fractals that are in some way related to Platonic solids, Archimedean solids or their higher dimensional generalizations.  These fractals are typically well suited to 3D printing in metal, and that is my medium of choice in this case.</p>
				<br>
				<p>2.  Klienian limit set fractals in three or more dimensions.  The 2D case of this class of fractals is famously explored in the book "Indra's Pearls" - for three or more dimensions, one must dig into the literature.  Although I have succeeded once or twice in 3D printing a member of this family, this is typically not viable and glass etchings or holograms are a better medium in this case.</p>
