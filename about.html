      <p>I often find that I have difficulty saying what exactly it is that I do.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Although I am trained as a mathematician - I have a PhD in Math from Cambridge - what I
        do in reality is much more interdisciplinary. In my work life, I design and code computer algorithms for solving
        a range of problems, varying
        from image processing to seismic wave simulation to methane leak detection. I don't think that there is any neat
        label for this kind of work - in the period from 2010-2015,
        I found that I was usually given the work title "research engineer", a term that I think my then boss made up.
        These days, the buzzword seems to be "data scientist".</p>
      <br>
      <p>For my personal projects I'm mainly interested in mathematics as an art form. My objective is to take abstract
        ideas and to make them tangible; my three main mediums for doing so
        are 3D prints, glass etchings, and most recently digital holograms. More often then not, I don't know when I
        start a project what the object I'm trying to visualize looks
        like, and in that sense I view mathematical art less as a process of creation and more as one of discovery.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Just to drive that last point home, here's an example of one of my (currently unpublished) pieces - it's a 3D
        cross-section of <em>5D</em> Menger sponge. Did I design it to look that way? No.
        Do I have any idea <em>why</em> it looks the way that it does? Well, I've managed to figure out why it has the
        rotational symmetries that it does, but that's as far as I've gotten.</p>

      <p> Some of my better work has been presented at - and published in the proceeding of - <a
          href="https://www.bridgesmathart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridges</a>, a mathematical
        art conference that I attend every summer.</p>
