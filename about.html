		<p>I often find that I have trouble saying what it is exactly that I do.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Although I am trained as a mathematician - I have a PhD in Math from Cambridge - what I 
		do in reality is much more interdiscplinary.  In my work life, I design and code computer algorithms for solving a problems that
		vary from image processing to seismic imaging to methane leak detection.  I don't think that there is any neat label for this kind of work - in the period from 2010-2015,
		I found that I was usually given the work title "research engineer", a term that I think my then boss made up.  These days, the buzzword seems to be "data scientist".</p>
		<br>
		<p>For my personal projects I'm mainly interested in mathematics as an art form. My objective is to take abstract ideas and to make them tangible; my three main mediums for doing soft
		are 3D prints, glass etching, and most recently digital holography.  More often then not, I don't know when I start a project what the object I'm trying to visualize is going to look
		like, and in that sense I view mathematical art less a process of creation and more one of discovery.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Just to drive that last point home, here's an example of one of my pieces - it's a 3D cross-section of <em>5D</em> Menger sponge.  Did I design it to look that way?  No.
		Do I have any idea <em>why</em> it looks the way that it does?  Well, I've managed to figure out why it has the rotational symmetries that it does, but that's as far as I've gotten.
