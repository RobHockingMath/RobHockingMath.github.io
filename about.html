		<p>I often find that I have difficulty saying what exactly it is that I do.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Although I am trained as a mathematician - I have a PhD in Math from Cambridge - what I 
		do in reality is much more interdisciplinary.  In my work life, I design and code computer algorithms for solving a range of problems, varying
		from image processing to seismic wave simulation to methane leak detection.  I don't think that there is any neat label for this kind of work - in the period from 2010-2015,
		I found that I was usually given the work title "research engineer", a term that I think my then boss made up.  These days, the buzzword seems to be "data scientist".</p>
		<br>
		<p>For my personal projects I'm mainly interested in mathematics as an art form. My objective is to take abstract ideas and to make them tangible; my three main mediums for doing so
		are 3D prints, glass etchings, and most recently digital holograms.  More often then not, I don't know when I start a project what the object I'm trying to visualize looks
		like, and in that sense I view mathematical art less as a process of creation and more as one of discovery.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Just to drive that last point home, here's an example of one of my (currently unpublished) pieces - it's a 3D cross-section of <em>5D</em> Menger sponge.  Did I design it to look that way?  No.
		Do I have any idea <em>why</em> it looks the way that it does?  Well, I've managed to figure out why it has the rotational symmetries that it does, but that's as far as I've gotten.</p>

		<p> Some of my work has been presented at (and published in the proceeding of) <a href="https://www.bridgesmathart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridges</a>, a mathematical art conference that I attend every summer.  However, Bridges
		only happens once a year and has a strict (one might even say "draconian") rule of one project per person per year.  Therefore, Bridges alone is incapable of absorbing my output,
		and since I am unaware of any similar conferences, much of it remains unpublished.</p>
