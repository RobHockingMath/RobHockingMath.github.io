            <p>Blackhole visualization is not new, with the first rendering (to my knowledge) done in the late 70s.  In 2014, Interstellar brought black hole visualization to the masses with the spectacular and 
			mostly scientifically accurate rendering of the black hole Gargantua.  It's therefore a fair question to ask - why bother?</p>
			<br>
			<p>There a couple of layers to the answer.  First and foremost, while the internet abounds with renders of black holes nothing - not even Interstellar - achieves the level of realism that is possible
			with a hologram.  Even simple stereo 3D is a major jump in realism what is out there, and yet the only paper I was able to find on stereo 3D black hole visualization in my research for this project
			seems to mostly talk about how black holes "break" stereo 3D.  But full-parallax digital holograms, when done well, have the capacity to achieve a level of realism that goes far beyond stereo 3D.
			Some full color holograms are so realistic that if nobody told you, you wouldn't know that you were looking at a hologram.  To me, nothing demonstrates this more aptly than <a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-30-15-27531&id=478846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the piece below</a> by Philippe Gentet, 
			which he showed to me in his lab in Seoul.  Telling me that one of the figurines was genuine and the other a hologram, has asked me to guess which is which.  Answering (honestly) that I had no idea, he
			then adjusted a knob causing one of the figurines to dim.  I fell for the trick an stated that the dimmed figurine must be the hologram (it wasn't).</p>
