			<h1>Black Hole Digital Hologram</h1>
            <p>
			<br>
			<br>
            <p>Blackhole visualization is not new, with the first rendering (to my knowledge) done in the late 70s.  In 2014, Interstellar brought black hole visualization to the masses with the spectacular and 
			mostly scientifically accurate rendering of the black hole Gargantua.  It's therefore a fair question to ask - why bother?</p>
			<br>
			<p>There a couple of layers to the answer.  First and foremost, while the internet abounds with renders of black holes nothing - not even Interstellar - achieves the level of realism that is possible
			with a hologram.  Even simple stereo 3D is a major jump in realism what is out there, and yet the only paper I was able to find on stereo 3D black hole visualization in my research for this project
			seems to mostly talk about how black holes "break" stereo 3D.  But full-parallax digital holograms, when done well, have the capacity to achieve a level of realism that goes far beyond stereo 3D.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Some full color holograms are so realistic that if nobody told you, you wouldn't know that you were looking at a hologram.  To me, nothing demonstrates this more aptly than <a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-30-15-27531&id=478846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the piece below</a> by Philippe Gentet, 
			which he showed to me in his lab in Seoul.  Telling me that one of the figurines was genuine and the other a hologram, has asked me to guess which is which.  Answering (honestly) that I had no idea, he
			then adjusted a knob causing one of the figurines to dim.  I fell for the trick an stated that the dimmed figurine must be the hologram (it wasn't).</p>

			<br>
			<br>
			<p>I'm not doing to try and argue that my black hole hologram <em>succeeded</em> in achieving the realism of the piece above - rather, this is an argument that digital holography may be the optimal medium
			for black hole visualization, and that it's worth a shot.</p>
			<br>
			<p>When I began this project, it wasn't even clear to me that black holes would "work" in stereo 3D.  It was entirely possible that the disortion they produce would simply prove too confusing to our eyes.  In fact,
			the sheer absence of stereo 3D black holes on the internet (as well as the one paper I mentioned above) suggested that this was likely.  So, the first step was to successfully produce a black hole stereo pair.  This was an
			"off-ramp" for the project in the sense that if it failed, a hologram also could not be made and there was no point in continuing.</p>
			<br>
			<p> Black holes are visible mainly because they bend light.  To the best of my knowledge, it is not possible to render one within rasterization based rendering engine like 3D Studio Max or Blender.  You need to use a
			raytracer, and you need to modify it so that the rays move along curved trajectories defined by the geodesic equations of the black hole - this is called <em> nonlinear ray tracing</em> and is illustrated below.  I will not 
			go into the details here other than to say that nonlinear raytracing has been well understood for decades, is simple enough to implement that a talented high school student could do it, and to provide the following reference [ref].

			<br>
			<br>
			<p>I have a raytracer which I have been maintaining since undergrad.  I had previously given it the ability to render black holes under the simplifying assumption of an environment at infinity; however, to 
			generate an interesting stereo pair, I needed to have an environment a finite distance from the black hole.  I made the necessary changes to the code and initially settled on a black hole hovering over and 
			infinite ocean, surrounded by a firey accretion disk and with an aurora in the background (as per the two images below).  To my relief, the 3D worked.  To view the 3D yourself, simply cross your eyes as per the technique here.  You do you should notice
			that the 3D effect of the black hole itself is kind of like a marble, and with the sky behind the black hole seeming to bend into the screen.

			<br>
			<p>This was good news - it meant that a black hole hologram could be built in principle.  However, I knew from Jacques Desbian's course that my current setup wasn't going to work.  For reasons which at the time
			of writing I still do not understand, digital holograms suffer from <em>holographic depth of field</em>: objects exactly at the hologram plane are perfectly in focus, whereas as you move either in front of or behind
			it they become out of focus.  For the type of reflection hologram I would be making, the rough rule is if your holographic plane has width w and height h, then objects in your 3D scene should be placed no more than 
			one third of max(w,h) in front of the holographic plane, and no more than two thirds behind it.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This meant that my ocean extending out to stars at infinity were going to be a problem.  I decided to keep the basic idea of a black hole over water, but to enclose the water with walls to form an underground room.
			Drawing inspiration from my vague memories of visiting the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul twelve years earlier, I added pillars coming out of the water with Islamic tiling on the sides as well as on the ceiling.  
			For the walls, I stuck to a simple checkerboard pattern, which I felt made the optical distortion induced by the black hole (which I had put between the pillars) stand out more.
			In the rendering below, I've intentionally separated out the result with with no shading, the result with shading alone, and the overall result.  This is because accurate shading of the environment of a black Hole
			is non-trivial and has some interesting properties that I want to discuss.</p>

			<br>
			<br>
			<p>When one does shading in a raytracer, the typical approach is to find the straight line joining a point to be shaded with a light, and shade based on the distance to the light, and the angle with which the light ray strikes
			the surface to be shaded.  This becomes enormously more complex when one is dealing with a black hole, because:</p>
			<br>
			<p>		1.  Finding a light ray connecting two points in a black hole spacetime is a non-trivial boundary value problem.</p>
			<p>		2.  It turns out that there are typically infinitely many solutions.</p>
			<br>
			<p>To handle this, I decided to use a non-linear variant of the <em>Photon mapping</em> algorithm.  In brief, Photon mapping works by casting a large number of light rays from each light in a 3D scene into the scene, and keeping track
			of where they land.  When shading a point, one then simply counts how many photons have landed "nearby".  This approach neatly sidesteps the thorny issue raised above.</p>
			<br>
			<p> Photon mapping is famous for its ability to render realistic caustics - that is, bright areas in a scene where light has been focused by something like a glass sphere.  I had wondered for a long time whether or
			one might similarly get "black hole caustics" due to the focusing of light by a black hole.  The answer is yes - this is precisely the bright spot on the surface of the water in middle and right images above.  In this case, the light (invisible) is directly
			above the black hole (close to the ceiling) and it gets focused to a point on the water surface directly below the black hole as it curves around it.  This is perhaps easiest to see it by looking at a map of where 
			the photons land on the water, with and without the black hole.
